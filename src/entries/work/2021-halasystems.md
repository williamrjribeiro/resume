<b>Engineering Leadership:</b> Promoted to Principal Engineer and unofficial tech lead of one of the product teams. Besides my daily individual contributions to frontend and back-end codebases, I was also responsible for many other initiatives: defining engineering culture, technical stack decisions, maintaining excellence across teams, developing the technical parts of the hiring process, mentoring, and a few more things.

<b>AI-Powered Solutions:</b> Collaborated closely with AI researchers, ML specialists, and ETL data engineers to deliver user-facing applications leveraging complex AI capabilities. Integrated advanced audio processing systems for transcription, denoising, and translation across multiple languages, expanding into image processing solutions for humanitarian crisis response.

<b>Frontend Architecture:</b> Architected mission-critical applications using React, TypeScript, and Next.js with MUI components, focusing on Core Web Vitals optimization. Implemented React GL for complex geospatial interfaces, delivering interactive mapping solutions for humanitarian early warning systems.

<b>Performance Optimization:</b> Used standard frontend profiling tooling to detect performance bottlenecks, crucial for the resource-constrained environments our users face. Implemented code-splitting, lazy loading, and SSR/SSG techniques to reduce bundle sizes and improve application load times. Advanced React rendering optimizations were also implemented to create a great UX.

<b>Progressive Web Applications:</b> Engineered offline-first PWAs with sophisticated local-first, optimistic UI and RTL support. These optimized apps are essential for our users in Syria who face challenging environments with intermittent connectivity and operate on low-cost mobile devices.

<b>Modern Development Stack:</b> Migrated many repositories to modern JavaScrtipt developing tools like pnpm, Vite, and Vitest. Replaced a couple of GraphQL-based applications with NextJS, leveraging its server-side rendering and easy API integration between client and server.

<b>Serverless Architecture:</b> Designed and implemented distributed serverless applications using AWS CDK, SST, Serverless framework, and Terraform using most AWS managed resources. This approach significantly reduced our operational burden and increased our speed and agility.
