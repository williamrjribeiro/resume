As Eddisrupt's ambassador, my goal is to promote our mission to disrupt the education sector by providing high-quality learning materials and mentoring programs for an accessible price. I produce content like blog posts, presentations, and workshops concerning software engineering topics. The best part is mentoring our students to become great software engineers and applying for their first jobs in the industry.
