<b>Founding Product Team Member:</b> Selected as one of the first employees to establish the Lisbon office product team, solving real problems for VW's customers and dealerships through direct interaction. I completed intensive onboarding in Berlin with our experienced German colleagues and quickly adopted Extreme Programming (XP) practices, including test-driven development and pair programming.

<b>Frontend Excellence:</b> Architected responsive, accessible applications using React and TypeScript with Storybook for component documentation. Significantly improved rendering performance by introducing and teaching MobX state management to the team, creating architecture patterns that were adopted across multiple teams.

<b>Engineering Practices:</b> Embraced DevOps culture with Infrastructure as Code, AWS cloud services, and GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipelines. Championed TDD with Jest and React Testing Library while implementing end-to-end testing with NightwatchJS to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

<b>Technical Leadership:</b> Conducted technical interviews through collaborative pairing sessions using TDD methodologies, coaching colleagues on effective technical assessment techniques to strengthen the organization's hiring processes.

<b>Full-Stack Development:</b> Built robust backend services using Golang and Kotlin with PostgreSQL databases, applying domain-driven design principles. Additionally, I designed and developed the company's first public website (vwds.pt), creating an engaging digital presence.
