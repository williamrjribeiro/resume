My wife and I decided to do something extraordinary to celebrate our 30th birthday: fulfil our dreams! Our Bucket List tooks all around the world on a journey that took 13 months, from february 2015 to march 2016. We did a lot of planning and preparations. It was a life chaning experience that taught us we can make our dreams come true. You can find some of our stories in our [travel blog](https://explorers3dot0.blogspot.com/).
