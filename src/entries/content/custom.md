My wife and I decided to do something extraordinary to celebrate our 30th birthday: fulfill our dreams! Our Bucket List took us on a worldwide journey that took 13 months, from February 2015 to March 2016. We did a lot of planning, preparations, and some sacrifices but it was worth it. It was a life-changing experience that taught us we can make our dreams come true. Some of our stories are in our travel blog [Explorers 3.0](https://explorers3dot0.blogspot.com/).
