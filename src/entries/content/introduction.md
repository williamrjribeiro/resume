title: About Me
---

"If AI can understand emotions, surely it can understand why my code works on localhost but breaks in production!" As a senior fullstack engineer with 15+ years of experience, I build bridges between complex AI capabilities and human-centered interfaces. My expertise unites cutting-edge frontend development (React, TypeScript, Next.js) with the art of making AI accessible and meaningful to users. From optimizing interfaces for Syria's humanitarian crisis zones to collaborating with AI researchers on audio processing systems, I've mastered the delicate balance between technical excellence and human empathy. I thrive at the intersection of high-performance engineering and valuable productsâ€”creating applications that don't just function flawlessly but also understand and respond to human needs.
