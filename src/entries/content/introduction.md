<i>"If AI can understand emotions, surely it can understand why my code works on localhost but breaks in production!"</i>

Iâ€™m a senior full-stack engineer with over 15 years of experience, specializing in connecting complex AI capabilities with user-friendly interfaces. Skilled in front-end development (React, TypeScript, Next.js), I focus on making AI accessible and relevant.

From optimizing interfaces for humanitarian efforts in Syria to collaborating with researchers on audio processing, I balance technical skill with human empathy. I create applications that not only work seamlessly but also respond to user needs.
